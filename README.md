# Applied Machine Learning
**What is Machine Learning ?** ML is an area of AI research providing powerful tools that enable machines (computers) to find 
**models** describing data and the correlations between them, to
* **predict** future outcomes or developments given previous data (weather, stock market)
* **classify** unknown input given known, classified data (scene contains pedestrian or not) 
* **identify** structures in unseen, unlabeled data (grouping people according to different attributes)
* **decide** upon next steps or actions to take to maximise reward (new measurement, robot action)

## Assignments
* Assignment 1: In this lab, we will only review the Python syntax, linear algebra, and important numpy features.
* Assignment 2: The goal of this lab assignment is to get acquainted with **WEKA**, *Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis*, and to learn how to load data sets into the WEKA tool. Then, we will experiment with some **clustering** and **classification** algorithms. <br>
In addition, in the second part of the assignment, we will explore some programming concepts in Python, SciKitLearn, and partially Numpy to implement a **decision tree** classifier and compare it with the provided one in SciKitLearn. Then, we will get acquainted with the simplified version of the MNIST dataset provided in SciKitLearn, and explore the effect of (some) data preprocessing on the learning process.
